# Bash scripting - reusing your code

This is obviously too deep of a conversation for a single markdown file, but I'm going to throw in a cheat-sheet-style list here of things that I find interesting or otherwise didn't know as I go along, I have previous scripting experience so the level of detail you require my vary, but addition resources are available online, and just a google away. 

Bash is unlike other programming languages in that you are scripting at the Operating System level, so you are then possibly going to run into multiple languages being used in a single script, for instance, with the awk command.
