# Linux Forensics 

While not all of the information is from the same source, and I will attempt to source any information back to the original source I found it from, this is primarily notes taken while following the Linux Forensics Course on [Pentester Academy](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=20). This is in no way a replacement for that valuable resource, but would be an excellent reference source after the course is complete. I would recommend subscribing for the best learning experience.

A collection of notes while learning Linux Basics to Linux Forensics. I will also be documenting basic Linux commands, and other linux related tips that I cross along the way. While this may be useful for a basic linux user to grow into a more intermediate linux user, it is not intended to teach you the basic fundamentals such as creating a linux boot drive, installing linux, or even basic terminal directory traversal/etc. I will try to provide some videos in [#supplemental links](#supplemental-links)
